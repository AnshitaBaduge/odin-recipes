# odin-recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. It focuses on building a recipe website using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.

## About this Project

In this project, I have built a simple website that displays recipes. Each recipe will include ingredients, instructions, and images. The goal is to practice web development fundamentals and version control workflow.
